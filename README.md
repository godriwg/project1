    <h2 id="rails">Creator of Ruby on Rails</h2>
    <p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> is an open-source web framework that's optimized for programmer happiness and beautiful code. I created Rails in 2003 by extracting it from <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> and continue to lead the development.</p>

    <p>Hundreds of thousands of programmers around the world have built amazing applications using Rails. Some of the more famous include <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>, <a href="http://500px.com">500px</a>, and <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>.

    <h2 id="basecamp">Founder & CTO at Basecamp</h2>
    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a> is the world's #1 project management tool and has been used by more than 15 million people. It's the best way to make progress on projects together, and it's famously easy to use. We've been around for more than a decade. I run the company together with my business partner, Jason Fried, and our lovely team of 45 programmers, designers, supporters, and sysops.</p>
    
    <p>(We were formerly known as 37signals, but <a href="http://37signals.com">changed the name of the business</a> in 2014.)</p>

    <h2 id="rework">Best-selling author</h2>
    <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/"><img src="images/rework/front-cover.png" width="257" style="margin-right:20px"></a><a href="http://37signals.com/rework/"><img src="images/rework/back-cover.png" width="257" style="margin-top: 10px"></a>

    <p><a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">REWORK</a> is a New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Sunday Times best seller with more than 300,000 copies sold around the world. It's a book about starting and running businesses a better way.</p>

    <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/"><img src="images/remote/remote_front.png" width="257" style="margin-right:20px; border: 1px solid silver"></a><a href="http://37signals.com/remote/"><img src="images/remote/remote_back.png" width="257" style="margin-top: 10px; border: 1px solid silver"></a>

    <p><a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">REMOTE: Office Not Required</a> is the new book, and it encapsulates all I've learned about working remotely for the past decade. It includes all the arguments for why the time is right for remote work to blossom, and for how you can navigate the pitfalls. It's in the same style as REWORK: Short, wonderfully illustrated, and to the point.</p>
    
    <p>I also co-wrote <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com">Getting Real</a>, the predecessor to REWORK, and <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="driver">Le Mans & WEC class-winning racing driver</h2>
    <p>After climbing the ladders of racing for five years, I finally won my class in the 82nd running of world's biggest endurance race: <a href="http://www.youngdriver-amr.com/index.php?view=news&id=170&archive=yes">24 hours of Le Mans</a>. On top of that, I won my class in the <a href="http://www.fiawec.com">World Endurance Championship</a>. What a 2014 season!</p>
      <p>This all happened with the wonderful <a href="http://www.youngdriver-amr.com">Aston Martin Racing (Young Driver)</a> team in our #95 Vantage V8 GTE-AM car, also known as "The Dane Train" (due to our all Danish driver line-up).</p>
    
    <img src="images/racing/amr2014-2.jpg" width="540" height="360" alt="Aston Martin #95">
    
    <p>In 2013, I also drove in the WEC, but with a prototype by OAK Racing in the LMP2 class. We finished 2nd at Le Mans, 2nd in the championship, and took 5 podium finishes in 8 races that year.</p>

    <img src="images/racing/lemans2013.jpg" width="540" height="337" alt="Me driving at Le Mans 2013">

    <p>With the results in 2014, I've won 4 races in the WEC, and been on the podium in 14 out of 16 races over the two seasons. Additionally, I've finished on the podium three times at the 12 hours of Sebring and taken two class wins in the LMP2 class in the 2012 ALMS season.</p>

    <p>I started racing sportscars in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K3dLCfrHfI">Cayman Interseries</a> in 2009, moved to 911 GT3 Cup Cars at the end of 2010 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwUt-CXsgho">winning the gold class in my first race!</a>), and then went all out in 2011 with races in GT3 Challenge, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBXYomaVsBQ">Radical Masters</a>, ALMS GTC, Grand-Am ST, and ILMC (in Lotus below).</p>

    <p>That was all warm up for my break-out season in 2012. Together with <a href="http://www.alms.com/teams/conquest-endurance">Conquest Endurance</a>, I competed in the American Le Mans Series with LMP2 class-wins at Mosport and Road America to finish second in the championship. That performance earned me SPEED's "Rookie of the Year" award.</p>

    <h2 id="speaker">Public speaker</h2>

    <p>I occasionally give talks on business and technology. My most popular talk is The Secret To Making Money Online, delivered at Startup School in 2008. It's about how you don't need to aim to be a billionaire or take lots of venture capital to have a successful startup (and life):</p>
